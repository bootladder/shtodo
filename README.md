To build, `go build`
To install, put the following line in bashrc
`source /path/to/shtodo/bash.sh`


Print out your todo.txt when you open up a new shell.
But not every time, only after a bit of time passes.

Install shell aliases:
vitodo
cattodo
pushtodo
pulltodo

Currently pushtodo and pulltodo use git.
